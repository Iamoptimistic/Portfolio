## 📊 Projects

### 1. ABALONE AGE PREDICTION
- **Description:** 
Abalone age prediction involves estimating the age of abalones, and marine molluscs, using measurable physical features instead of traditional ring counting, which is labour-intensive. Key features include shell dimensions (length, diameter, height), weight metrics (whole, shucked, viscera, and shell weight), and sex (male, female, or infant). Machine learning models, trained on datasets like the UCI Abalone Dataset, use these features to predict age accurately. This method supports sustainable fisheries by enabling efficient population management and conservation efforts. Streamlining age estimation facilitates better resource management, promoting ecological balance and aiding in the sustainable harvesting of abalone populations.
